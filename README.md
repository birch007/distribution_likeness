How to quantify the similarity of two distributions?

One of the most common task in machine learning  is comparing two distributions. Sometimes we want to decide whether two sample distributions are drawn from the same population. But sometimes we might want to know if the two sample distributions have a similar shape.

This notebook considers a toy example where similarity of  distributions are quantified by using Anderson-Darling k-sample significance level, Pearson correlation coefficient by two histograms,
and strength of linear coefficient in cubic fit for quantile-quantile plot.
